        <p class="description">Hi there! My name is Riley Gaffney and I have a passion for technology! Currently, I am a
            software tester for an Indigenous owned company "PLATO Testing". With my work history in testing, I
            discovered
            that not only do I want to be more involved in the back end of development, but that I can use my testing
            knowledge to improve my development skills.
